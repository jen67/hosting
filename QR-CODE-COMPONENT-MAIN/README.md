## My process
I first built the frame with html then I started adding my styles with CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

For a long time I thought that its only media querry that can be used to make my designs responsible but I was able to tackle that in this project.

### Continued development

I want to work more on developing responsive sites.


### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This website really helped me out to sort out some things I did not understand about responsiveness of a design.
