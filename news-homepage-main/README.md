## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-direction
- CSS column
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

while working on this project, I got the opportunity to use css variables and also use flex-direction and column count in different sections of my code. Also I got to learn more about the menu Icon using javascript.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  flex-direction:column;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve more on my javascript skills and also learn how to implement the transparency that was applied on the mobile view menu area of this project I found it really hard.
