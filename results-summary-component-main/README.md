## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- css variables

### What I learned

This project haved helped me improve my attention to details at least to an extent and I was also able to use variables in my css. It also helped me research more on how to do some things, for example I had issue with the shadow part because it was not coming out the way I expected but I later learnt that I was because I was appling the shadow in the wrong place. And also this project helped me understand and appreciate the use of colors. I love the color combinations provided.

### Continued development

I intend to improve more in the use of javascript  and also the use of grid for designs.
